# Known Deviations — c02 vs. `SPEC.md`

**Status:** pinned to [jackwthake/C02](https://github.com/jackwthake/C02) commit
`9a9375e` (2026-07-02, branch `v1.1`), same baseline as `SPEC.md`.

This is the living half of the c02 language documentation — `SPEC.md` is the
stable normative contract; this file is the known-issues oracle a fuzz
harness should consult before treating a finding as *new*. Every entry here
is a place where `cc02`'s actual behavior diverges from what `SPEC.md`
specifies. If a fuzz run reproduces one of these, it's confirming a known
issue, not discovering one — only a *behavior change* from what's recorded
here (a deviation that no longer reproduces, or reproduces differently) is
noteworthy.

**Verification level** is marked per entry:
- **Executed** — reproduced by compiling (and, for the P-numbered items,
  running in the py65 emulator) the exact snippet shown, either while
  authoring this document or via upstream `cc02/tests/bug_test.py`
  (`python3 cc02/tests/bug_test.py` from the `C02` checkout — 23 of 24
  P-numbered regression tests are currently red; only P2-5 passes, and only
  by the coincidental memory-layout luck that test itself documents as
  non-robust).
- **Source** — derived from direct reading of `tokenizer.c` / `parser.c` /
  `analyzer.c`, not independently executed while authoring this document.
  Treat these as high-confidence but unconfirmed; re-verify before relying
  on one for a fuzzer's pass/fail oracle, especially if `cc02` changes.

Severity legend:
- **P0** — silent miscompile: analysis accepts the program, wrong machine
  code is emitted, no diagnostic anywhere.
- **P1** — loud failure: the compiler crashes or otherwise fails unsafely on
  a reasonable program.
- **P2** — robustness: a real gap, but latent or requiring an unusual
  program to trigger.
- **S** — semantic laxity: the type checker accepts something a stricter
  spec would reject.
- **G** — grammar quirk: a parser/lexer-level surprise, not itself
  incorrect, but easy to trip over or silently discard information.

## Lexer & Parser Quirks

### G-1: Unterminated block comment silently swallowed

```c
fn main() -> void { }
/* unterminated
```

**Verified:** `cc02 --syntax-check-only` exits `0` — clean, no diagnostic.
An unterminated `/*` consumes everything to EOF silently, asymmetric with
an unterminated string literal, which *does* error. A stray `/*` near the
end of a file (e.g. from a botched edit) silently discards the rest of the
file rather than failing loudly.

### G-2: `decl fn ... interrupt` drops the qualifier

```c
decl fn irq() interrupt -> void;
fn main() -> void { }
```

**Verified:** parses cleanly (`--syntax-check-only` exit `0`); `--ast-dump`
shows `ForwardDecl fn irq() -> void` with no trace of `interrupt`. The
`interrupt` token is consumed syntactically after the parameter list, but
the forward-declaration AST node (`node_t.fwd_decl`) has no field to store
it — the qualifier is unrepresentable downstream of the parser, not merely
unused.

### G-3: `for`-init cannot reuse an existing variable

```c
fn main() -> void { u8 i = 0; for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) { } }
```

**Verified:** `cc02 --syntax-check-only` → `error: unexpected token ... ';'
expected after for loop initialiser` (exit `4`). The init clause's
non-declaration branch parses a bare expression (no `=` support) — only a
fresh declaration (`for (u8 i = 0; ...)`) or an assignment-free expression
is legal in that slot. The incrementer clause, by contrast, does support
`=`/compound-assign.

### G-4: `for`-init and block statements disambiguate differently

The identical token shape `a * b` is resolved by two different mechanisms
depending on position:
- As a block statement, disambiguation is purely shape-based (skip `*`
  tokens, check for a following identifier) — `a * b;` **always** parses as
  declaring `b : a*`, regardless of whether `a` is a real type.
- As a `for`-init clause, disambiguation instead uses the whole-file
  struct-name prescan (same mechanism as cast disambiguation, §6.6/G-5) —
  `for (a * b; ...)` is a **multiplication expression** unless `a` is a
  known struct name.

So `for (Point p = get_point(); ...)` only declares `p` correctly because
`Point` was found by the prescan; the equivalent statement at block scope
would declare correctly regardless.

*(Source: derived from reading `parse_for_initializer_clause` vs.
`parse_stmt`'s identifier-led branch in `parser.c`; not independently
executed.)*

### G-5: Struct-name shadowing misparses a cast

```c
struct Point { u8 x; u8 y; }
fn f() -> void {
  u8 Point = 5;         // local shadows the struct name
  u8 y = (Point) - 1;   // misparses as a CAST to struct Point, not "5 - 1"
}
```

Cast-vs-grouped-expression disambiguation (§6.6) is driven by a one-time,
whole-file, scope-blind prescan of struct names — it has no way to know a
local variable has shadowed a struct name by the time it reaches this
expression. This fails loudly downstream (a struct-cast-by-value or type
error), not silently — accepted upstream as a known, intentional edge case,
not fixed.

### G-6: Binary literals undocumented upstream

`0b`/`0B`-prefixed binary integer literals (`0b1010`) are a real, fully
supported literal form at the lexer level, but the upstream `README.md`'s
prose omits them (only mentions decimal/hex explicitly in one place).
Purely a documentation gap — `SPEC.md` §1.3 now covers it. Not a behavioral
deviation.

---

## Codegen: Verified Silent Miscompiles & Robustness Gaps

Full detail and line references live in the upstream `docs/BUG_REPORT.md`;
this section is a condensed, fuzzer-facing restatement. Regression tests
for all of these exist in upstream `cc02/tests/bug_test.py`.

### P0-1: Nested struct field writes are lost

```c
struct Inner { u8 v; u8 w; }
struct Outer { u8 pad; Inner nest; }
fn main() -> void {
  Outer o;
  o.nest.w = 9;      // stores into a temp copy of o.nest, discarded
  PORTB = o.nest.w;  // reads the real (never-written) o -> garbage
}
```

For a one-level access (`p.x = 5`) the base lowers to a real variable and
the store hits real storage. For a *nested* access, the base is itself a
field access, so it lowers via a load into a temporary, and the store
mutates that temporary — the original object is never written. Also
affects `++`/`--` on a nested field, and any `a.b.c = ...` through a
pointer base. **Verified:** `PORTB` reads `0`, not `9`.

### P0-2: Cast binds to the whole following expression

```c
u16 w = 511;
u8 x = (u8)w / 2;   // computes (u8)(w / 2) = 0xFF, not ((u8)w) / 2 = 0x7F
```

The cast operand is parsed at `logical_or` precedence (the top of the
expression grammar), not `unary` — so a cast binds looser than any C
programmer would expect. The companion trap: `u16 r = (u16)a * b;` casts
the *product* `a * b`, not `a` alone, so the multiply still runs at 8-bit
width and the high byte of the "widened" result is always `0` — since
casting is the only way to request a widened multiply, this silently
defeats that idiom entirely. **Verified:** result is `0xFF`, expected
`0x7F`; `20 * 20` widened-multiply stores `144` with high byte `0` instead
of `400` (`$0190`). Most likely footgun for hand-written or generated test
programs to hit by accident.

### P0-3: Narrow store through wide pointer/register leaves stale high byte

```c
u16 g = 0xFFFF;
fn main() -> void {
  u16 *p = &g;
  *p = 5;    // g becomes 0xFF05, not 0x0005
}
```

`TAC_STORE` writes only the source operand's width; unlike `TAC_COPY`, it
never widens the RHS to the destination's (pointee/register) type. Same
issue for a `u16` hardware register. **Verified:** `g` = `0xFF05`.

### P0-4: Increment through deref or register doesn't store back

```c
u8 g = 10;
fn main() -> void {
  u8 *p = &g;
  ++*p;      // increments a temp copy; g stays 10
}
```

Only the field-access operand shape of `++`/`--` gets a full
load/modify/store; any other operand shape (dereference, hardware
register) increments whatever temporary the load produced, with no store
back. Plain `++local`/`++global` are correct. **Verified:** `g` stays `10`;
`PORTB = 5; ++PORTB;` likewise leaves the register unchanged. The analyzer
accepts both (dereference passes the lvalue check), so this is fully
silent.

### P0-5: Non-literal global initializers are silently dropped

```c
u8  a = 2 + 3;              // constant-fold candidate — dropped
i8  b = -5;                 // negated literal is NODE_UNARY — dropped!
Point p = Point{ .x = 7 };  // struct initializer — dropped
```

Only a bare number or string literal initializer is captured during IR
generation; every other shape falls through to "no initializer" with no
diagnostic — the analyzer type-checks and accepts the expression, then the
IR throws it away. The `-5` case is the sharpest trap: *positive* literals
initialize fine, so adding a minus sign silently un-initializes the
variable. **Verified:** all three leave the global's RAM bytes unwritten.

### P0-6: By-value struct params/returns are truncated

```c
struct Point { u8 x; u8 y; }
fn f(u8 dummy, Point p) -> u8 { return p.y; }
fn main() -> void {
  Point p = Point{ .x = 1, .y = 2 };
  PORTB = f(9, p);   // returns 1 (p.x!), not 2
}
```

The analyzer accepts by-value struct parameters and returns (only checks
the struct exists), but the ABI moves at most 2 bytes per argument and the
function prologue sizes a by-value struct at 1 byte. **Verified:** returns
`p.x` instead of `p.y`; a struct-returning function reads back `0` for a
field that was actually set. Note: a *single*-parameter version of this
test passes by accident (caller/callee happen to reuse the same storage
slot) — that aliasing is why this survived the existing test suite before
`docs/BUG_REPORT.md` was written.

### P0-7: Writes through a pointer to a caller's local are undone on return

```c
fn set(u8 *p) -> void { *p = 5; }
fn main() -> void {
  u8 x = 0;
  set(&x);
  PORTB = x;    // 0, not 5
}
```

A callee's prologue saves the *entire content* of every zero-page slot it
uses, and its epilogue restores those bytes on return. Caller locals live
in the same zero-page region a callee allocates from — so a write through a
pointer into the caller's frame lands on a slot the callee saved on entry,
and gets reverted when the callee returns. **Verified:** `x` stays `0`.
This makes out-parameters — the primary reason `&` exists — silently broken
whenever the target is a local (not a global; `&global` uses a RAM address,
unaffected).

### P0-8: Narrow signed return zero-extends instead of sign-extending

```c
fn f() -> i16 { return -5; }
fn main() -> void {
  i16 r = f();
  if (r < 0) { PORTB = 1; } else { PORTB = 2; }   // takes else — r is +251
}
```

The return path fabricates a `0x00` high byte for byte indices past the
source operand's width, rather than sign-extending — `TAC_COPY` and
`TAC_CAST` both handle this correctly elsewhere; `TAC_RETURN` doesn't.
**Verified:** takes the `else` branch (`r == 251`, not negative).

### P0-9: Interrupt handlers can corrupt mainline computation

```c
fn add(u8 a, u8 b) -> u8 { return a + b; }
fn nmi() interrupt -> void { u8 t = add(40, 40); }
fn main() -> void {
  u8 r = add(2, 3);   // if NMI fires here, between arg-staging and JSR...
  PORTB = r;           // ...r can come out as 80, not 5
}
```

Interrupt entry saves A/X/Y and the handler's own zero-page slots, but not
the shared ABI argument zone, the shared return-value slot, or the shared
arithmetic-helper zones — all of which are also used by whatever mainline
code the interrupt preempts. **Verified deterministically** by firing the
NMI at the exact emulator step where `main` has staged `add`'s arguments
but not yet executed `JSR`: `PORTB` reads `80` (`add(40,40)`, the handler's
own call) instead of `5`. On real hardware this presents as a
timing-dependent, rarely-reproducible wrong value. Handlers that avoid
calling functions and avoid `*`/`/`/`%` are unaffected.

### P1-1: Address-of a struct field segfaults the compiler

```c
struct Point { u8 x; u8 y; }
fn main() -> void {
  Point p;
  u8 *q = &p.x;   // SIGSEGV in cc02 itself
}
```

`&`'s codegen path looks up the operand by name unconditionally, but when
the operand is a field access or dereference, the lowered form is a
temporary, not a named variable — the name lookup dereferences a small
integer reinterpreted as a string pointer. **Verified:** `cc02` crashes
with SIGSEGV (`strcmp` in the backtrace). The analyzer accepts this program
— see [S-6](#s-6-lvalue-checking-is-shallow) for why. Even absent the crash,
the emitted code would be doubly wrong: address of a temp copy, plus
[P0-7](#p0-7-writes-through-a-pointer-to-a-callers-local-are-undone-on-return)
on top.

### P2-1: `reg` addresses above `0xFFFF` are silently truncated

```c
reg u8 X @ 0x10000;
fn main() -> void { X = 0x77; }
```

Register addresses are parsed as a raw literal with no range check anywhere
downstream (ordinary expression literals *do* get range-checked;
register addresses are the one literal that bypasses it). **Verified:**
compiles cleanly and the store lands at `$0000` — overwriting the
zero-page frame pointer.

### P2-2: Struct values accepted as arithmetic/condition operands

```c
struct Point { u8 x; u8 y; }
fn main() -> void {
  Point a; Point b;
  Point c = a + b;        // "type-checks" — accepted
}
// separately:
fn main() -> void {
  Point a;
  if (a) { }               // also accepted — no scalar/condition check
}
```

Same-named struct types are "compatible" by the struct-name-match rule, and
binary/condition operands are never required to be scalar. Codegen then
sizes the struct operand at 1 byte and only touches the first field's
worth of bytes, leaving the rest of the result garbage. **Verified:** both
forms compile (`rc=0`).

### P2-3: Interrupt handlers can be called directly

```c
reg u8 PORTB @ 0x6000;
fn irq() interrupt -> void { PORTB = 1; }
fn main() -> void { irq(); }
```

The analyzer knows a callee is an interrupt handler (it validated the
qualifier in pass 1) but doesn't reject a direct call to one. The handler
was emitted with a save/`RTI` epilogue; a plain `JSR` call pops bytes that
were never pushed and `RTI` misinterprets the return address as status +
PC. **Verified:** compiles (`rc=0`); runtime stack corruption follows.

### P2-4: Separators are optional, not required

```c
f(1 2);                          // parses as a call with args, comma missing
fn g(u8 a u8 b) -> u8 { ... }    // params, comma missing
Point{ .x = 1 .y = 2 };          // struct-init fields, comma missing
```

The list-parsing loops for call arguments, parameters, and struct-init
fields consume a comma *if present* but don't require one — each just
relies on the closing delimiter. **Verified:** all three parse (`rc=0`).
Harmless today, but makes a dropped-comma typo legal, and will read
differently once/if expressions can start with unary `-` in these
positions (`f(1 -2)` is one argument today; with a required comma, `f(1,
-2)` unambiguously reads as two).

### P2-5: Deep loop nesting overflows a fixed stack

80 levels of nested `while`/`for` write past a fixed 64-entry
loop-tracking array with no bounds check. **Verified as a real
out-of-bounds write** (confirmed via source, not black-box output) — but on
the *current* struct layout the corruption happens to be self-consistent
(the overwritten neighbor field mirrors the intended stack at a displaced
index), so `break`/`continue` targets still come out right and nothing
externally visible fails. This is the one `bug_test.py` entry that's
currently green, and the test itself documents that it cannot go red from
the outside on this particular build — it exists to catch the crash on a
future layout where the corruption lands somewhere live.

### P2-6: Global allocation never checks the RAM ceiling

Enough `u16` globals (~8000, i.e. ~16 KB) exceed the ~15.8 KB of available
RAM (`$0200`–`$3FFF`) with no diagnostic — allocation just keeps advancing
past the ceiling (and, in principle, could wrap the 16-bit address space
entirely). **Verified:** compiles cleanly (`rc=0`) where it should be a
codegen-stage error, the same way ROM overflow already is.

### P2-7: Pointer arithmetic is unscaled

```c
u16 *p = ...;
p + 1;   // advances by 1 byte, not by 2 (sizeof(u16))
```

`ptr + int` always advances by exactly one byte regardless of the pointee's
type/size — fine for the idiomatic `u8*` walk pattern (see `SPEC.md`
Appendix A), but silently diverges from C expectations on `u16*` or
struct-pointer arithmetic, with no diagnostic at any stage.

## Analyzer: Type-System & Semantic Laxity

### S-1: `void`/null-literal conflation

```c
fn main() -> void { void *vp; u8 x = vp; }
```

**Verified:** `cc02 --syntax-check-only` exits `0` — no diagnostic. The
literal `0` and every `void*`-typed *value* (not just the literal) share
one internal type representation (`void`, pointer depth 1), and the
type-compatibility check's very first rule fires on that representation
unconditionally, without ever inspecting the destination type. So a
genuine `void*` variable — not merely a null-pointer constant — is accepted
as compatible with *any* destination, including non-pointer scalars and
by-value structs. This is the single most consequential type-system gap in
the language: it defeats static checking anywhere a `void*` value flows
into a differently-shaped destination.

### S-2: No signedness checking

```c
i8 x = 200;        // out of i8's range, fits u8 — accepted, wraps negative
u8 y = someI8Var;  // accepted, no diagnostic
```

Type compatibility for same-width integer types only compares *width*
(`type_width`), never signedness — `i8`↔`u8` and `i16`↔`u16` are always
mutually "compatible" in both directions.

*(Source: `is_types_compatible` in `analyzer.c`; not independently executed
for this document, but structurally unambiguous from the code.)*

### S-3: Pointer arithmetic is order-sensitive

```c
fn g(u8 *p) -> void { u8 *b = p + 5; }   // compiles (rc 0)
fn g(u8 *p) -> void { u8 *b = 5 + p; }   // type error (rc 5):
                                          // "expected u8, found u8*"
```

**Verified both directions.** The pointer-arithmetic special case in binary
operator resolution only checks `left.is_ptr` — a pointer on the *right*
falls through to the generic compatibility check, which rejects mixing
pointer and non-pointer operands. `ptr - ptr` (both sides pointers) doesn't
hit the special case either (it explicitly requires the right operand to
be non-pointer); see [S-4](#s-4-pointer-difference-is-typed-as-a-pointer).

### S-4: Pointer difference is typed as a pointer

`ptr - ptr` (both operands the same pointer type) falls through to the
generic struct-name/kind/depth compatibility check — which two identically-
typed pointers pass — so the expression type-checks, but the **result type
is itself a pointer type**, not an integer/difference type. There is no
notion of a pointer-difference numeric type anywhere in the type system.

executed.)*

### S-5: Casts to non-struct types are unchecked

`(type)expr` for any non-struct destination type is accepted regardless of
the source expression's type — casting a struct to `u8`, or between
unrelated pointer types, produces no diagnostic. The source operand's type
is resolved only for its own side-effect diagnostics and is otherwise
discarded. (Struct destinations *are* checked — see `SPEC.md` §3.3 for the
`ERR_UNKNOWN_STRUCT`/`ERR_STRUCT_CAST_BY_VALUE` rules that do exist.)

*(Source: `NODE_CAST` handling in `analyzer.c`; not independently
executed.)*

### S-6: Lvalue-checking is shallow

```c
someFunctionCall().field = 5;   // accepted as an assignment target
```

The lvalue check inspects only the *top-level AST node kind*
(`NODE_IDENTIFIER` / `NODE_FIELD_ACCESS` / `NODE_DEREF`) — it never
recurses into whether the *base* of a field-access or deref chain is
addressable storage at all. A field access whose base is a call result (an
rvalue with no storage) is accepted purely because the outer node "looks
like" one of the three lvalue shapes. This is the root enabler of
[P1-1](#p1-1-address-of-a-struct-field-segfaults-the-compiler).

*(Source: `is_lvalue` in `analyzer.c`; not independently executed, but the
downstream P1-1 crash is empirically confirmed and consistent with this
explanation.)*

### S-7: Struct initializers needn't be complete or unique

```c
Point{ .x = 1 }              // .y silently left unset, no diagnostic
Point{ .x = 1, .x = 2 }      // duplicate field, no diagnostic
```

Fields omitted from a struct initializer produce no "missing field"
diagnostic, and the same field named twice in one initializer list is never
flagged as a duplicate — each `.field = expr` entry is checked
independently against the struct's field list.

*(Source: `NODE_STRUCT_INIT` handling in `analyzer.c`; not independently
executed.)*

### S-8: `decl` cannot prototype a same-file definition

```c
decl fn foo(u8 x) -> void;
fn foo(u8 x) -> void { }   // ERR_REDECLARATION
```

Pass 1 performs no merging between a `decl` forward declaration and a later
same-name definition in the same file — both are inserted into the
identical global-scope symbol table with no special-casing, so they
collide as an ordinary redeclaration. `decl` is intended for
cross-translation-unit references (multi-file linking); the familiar C
"prototype, then define later in the same file" idiom is not supported.

*(Source: `pass1_register_globals` in `analyzer.c`; not independently
executed.)*

### S-9: Shadowing check is asymmetric

A local variable or parameter that shadows a name visible in *any*
enclosing scope (including global) is rejected
(`ERR_SHADOWED_DECLARATION` — see `SPEC.md` §7.2). A **struct declared
inside a function body**, however, goes through a different registration
path that only checks same-scope redeclaration — it is never checked
against outer-scope shadowing. A local struct can legally share a name with
an outer-scope variable, function, global, or another struct, even though
"shadowing is disallowed" is otherwise a blanket rule in this language.

`analyzer.c`; not independently executed.)*

### S-10: `main`'s signature is unchecked

Only "a symbol named `main` exists and is a function" is verified — any
return type and any parameter list/count are accepted with no diagnostic.

*(Source: the end-of-`analyze()` check in `analyzer.c`; not independently
executed.)*

### S-11: `interrupt`-qualifier failure is a warning, not an error

A misnamed (`fn Nmi()`) or mis-signatured (`fn irq(u8 x)`, or a non-`void`
return) `interrupt`-qualified function does not fail compilation — it
prints `WARN_INVALID_INTERRUPT` to stderr and silently compiles as an
ordinary callable function, with the qualifier cleared before codegen ever
sees it. The build **succeeds**; the vector table simply doesn't point at
the intended handler. This is deliberate non-fatal-diagnostic design
upstream, not a bug — but exactly the kind of thing a fuzzer/linter should
flag as a distinct outcome class from a hard compile error.

*(Source: the interrupt-validation block in `pass1_register_globals`,
`analyzer.c`; not independently executed for this document, though the
mechanism — clearing `is_interrupt` before codegen — is unambiguous from
the code.)*

### S-12: `asm` blocks are unvalidated

The analyzer performs zero semantic checking on `asm { ... }` blocks —
mnemonic legality is deferred entirely to codegen (explicitly noted in-code
as out of scope for this pass). An invalid mnemonic produces no
analysis-stage diagnostic.

*(Source: `analyze_stmt`'s `NODE_ASM_BLOCK` case in `analyzer.c`; not
independently executed.)*

### S-13: Unused-variable diagnostics are unimplemented

`WARN_UNUSED_VARIABLE`, `WARN_UNUSED_FUNCTION`, `WARN_UNUSED_STRUCT`, and
`WARN_UNUSED_FIELD` are all defined in the warning enum and have
print-dispatch code in `errors.c`, but no code path in `analyzer.c` ever
constructs one — each `case` in the warning-print dispatcher immediately
returns with a `// unimplemented` comment. Do not treat "no unused-variable
warning" as evidence a variable is actually used; the check simply doesn't
exist yet.

*(Source: `print_warning` in `errors.c` cross-referenced against
`analyzer.c`; not independently executed.)*

### S-14: Missing-return detection is shallow

```c
fn f(u8 x) -> u8 {
  if (x) { return 1; }     // one-armed if, no else — NOT flagged, despite
}                            // falling through with no return when x == 0

fn g() -> u8 {
  while (cond) { ... }      // NOT flagged, whether or not this loop can
}                            // ever exit or ever returns
```

The check looks only at the function's *last top-level statement*'s node
kind — `NODE_RETURN`, `NODE_IF`, `NODE_WHILE`, `NODE_FOR`, `NODE_BLOCK` all
pass with no diagnostic, regardless of whether that statement actually
guarantees a return on every path. There is no control-flow/path-coverage
analysis. Conversely, dead code placed *after* an early, unconditional
`return` (making it the new last statement) **is** flagged, since it isn't
one of the five "may-return" kinds — a technically-correct but
easily-misread positive.

*(Source: `stmt_may_return` in `analyzer.c`; not independently executed.)*

### S-15: Negation doesn't change static signedness

```c
u8 x = 5;
-x;          // still typed u8 by the analyzer, despite representing a
             // two's-complement negative value at runtime
-(-5);       // the outer negate does NOT re-fold to u8 — only a unary
             // negate directly wrapping a NODE_NUMBER hits the
             // literal-retyping fast path; here it wraps another negate
```

Negating a *variable* never changes its static type. Negating a *literal*
re-derives a signed type only when the AST shape is exactly
`NODE_UNARY(-)` directly wrapping `NODE_NUMBER` — a second, outer negation
doesn't re-trigger that special case.

*(Source: literal-retyping logic in `resolve_expr_type`'s `NODE_UNARY`
case, `analyzer.c`; not independently executed.)*

### S-16: Struct field errors aren't poisoned

Top-level declarations (vars/globals/registers/params) that fail type
validation are poisoned to an error type in their symbol-table entry, so
every later use resolves silently to "already reported" with no repeated
diagnostic. **Struct fields don't get this treatment** — a bad field
(unknown type, invalid self-reference, etc.) is reported once but never
written back into the struct's stored field list, so every subsequent
access to that specific field independently re-resolves from the still-bad
declaration and can trigger further downstream diagnostics.

*(Source: `validate_toplevel_types`'s per-field loop in `analyzer.c`; not
independently executed.)*

### S-17: Parameter poisoning doesn't reach the function signature

When a parameter's declared type fails validation, the poisoned type is
written into a fresh local-scope symbol used for checking *uses of that
parameter inside the function body* — but the function's own
`SYMBOL_FUNCTION` entry (used to type-check arguments at every *call site*)
is never touched. In principle, a function with one invalid parameter type
could drive a bad type comparison at every call site, rather than being
poisoned once, unlike the treatment globals/registers get.

*(Source: `pass2_entry` parameter handling vs. `validate_toplevel_types` in
`analyzer.c`; not independently executed — this asymmetry is rare to
trigger in practice since it requires an invalid struct name in a
parameter's type.)*

### S-18: `ERR_WRONG_ARG_TYPE` is dead code

`ERR_WRONG_ARG_TYPE` is defined in the error enum and has rendering support
in `errors.c`, but is never actually constructed anywhere in `analyzer.c`
— function-call argument type mismatches always report through the generic
`ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH` (context `"function call"`) instead. Do not expect to
see `ERR_WRONG_ARG_TYPE` in compiler output; treat it as reserved/unused.
